## 📂 Folder Structure  

This repository contains several subdirectories, each housing negotiation agents created using different mathematical modeling techniques. Below is an overview of their contents:  

### 1️⃣ [Skew-Normal Distribution](Skew_normal_Distribution/)  
🔹 Contains agents based on the **Skew-Normal Distribution Function**.  
🔹 Refer to **Section 4.1.1** of *Automated Negotiation Agents in Modeling Single-Peaked Bidders: An Experimental Comparison* for methodology.  

### 2️⃣ [Normal Distribution](Normal_Distribution/)  
🔹 Contains agents based on the **Gaussian Function**.  
🔹 Refer to **Section 4.1.2** of *Automated Negotiation Agents in Modeling Single-Peaked Bidders: An Experimental Comparison* for methodology.  


### **3️⃣ General Triangular Function**  
These folders contain agents created using the **General Triangular Function**:  
- `Tri_1_90/`  
- `Tri_20_20/`  
- `Tri_70_30/`  

🔹 Refer to **Section 4.1.3** of *Automated Negotiation Agents in Modeling Single-Peaked Bidders: An Experimental Comparison* for methodology.
